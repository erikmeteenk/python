# Exercise 1
# Create a tuple called data with two values, (1, 2) and (3, 4)
data = ((1,2),(3,4))

# Exercise 2
# Loop over data and print the sum of each nested tuple
for i in data:
    sum = 0
    for j in i:
        sum +=j
    print(sum)


# Exercise 3
# Create the list [4, 3, 2, 1] and assign it to variable numbers
number = [4,3,2,1]

# Exercise 4
# Create a copy of the number list using [:]
number2 = number
print (number2)
# Exercise 5
# Sort the numbers list in numerical order
number2.sort()
print(number2)
