# Exercise 1
# print the integer 2 through 10 using a "for" loop
for x in range(2,11):
    print(x)


# Exercise 2
# print the integer 2 through 10 using a "while" loop
i = 2
while i < 11:
    print(i)
    i +=1





# Exercise 3
def doubles(a):
    
    for i in range(1,4):
        a = a*2
    print(a)
doubles(2)



# Call doubles() to double the number 2 three times
